# Shared GCP build cache

Trusted Linux amd64 correctness CI can use the GCP runner pool and 128 GiB Spot
remote executors. Workers have a local file cache, then the shared Buildbarn NVMe
CAS, then authoritative BuildBuddy storage. BuildBuddy continues to schedule
remote execution and receive build events. Bazel client action-cache requests and
repository downloads still use BuildBuddy directly; worker CAS traffic uses the
nearby layer. Object compression remains enabled.

Repository variables control rollout:

- `BUILD_CACHE_ENABLED=true` enables the integration.
- `RUNNER_DEFAULT` selects the GCP runner label (operations currently uses
  `linux-amd64-cipool-xl`).
- `BUILD_CACHE_ENDPOINT` is the private HTTP gateway origin supplied by cloud ops.

CI calls the full-SHA-pinned `elide-tools/buildcache` action.
Only successful network and GitHub OIDC identity verification exports
`ELIDE_BUILD_CACHE_ENABLED=true`; credential setup then selects
`--config=shared_cache`. That profile requests OCI isolation and pool
`bb-native-128`, inheriting the existing pinned image and toolchains. The action
also configures Gradle HTTP and sccache WebDAV for jobs that use those clients;
these protocols share the same CAS and backing store, with repository/ref-isolated
indexes. The HTTP gateway validates short-lived GitHub identity tokens; no
long-lived cache key is added to the action. Bazel retains its existing BuildBuddy
API-key permissions, separate from the HTTP gateway's repository/ref isolation.
The action does not install either client or change the pinned JDK/toolchains.

The checked-in workflow routes fork PRs to hosted local execution without
BuildBuddy secrets. A contributor can edit workflow YAML, so that condition alone
is not an authorization boundary. Organization policy requires maintainer
approval for every outside contributor's workflow run. Before approving, review
workflow changes and reject attempts to request private runners or privileged
contexts; the private runner group does not itself restrict workflow files.
ARM and explicit local/benchmark profiles retain their existing execution policy. No
organization-wide BuildBuddy default is changed. If setup fails, trusted jobs use
the existing hosted BuildBuddy profile. Clearing `BUILD_CACHE_ENABLED` rolls back
new jobs; no running job needs interruption. Local users can explicitly select
`--config=shared_cache` with their existing BuildBuddy credentials once enabled.

The cloud deployment and shared action must be available before enabling these
variables. Deployment and telemetry are managed in the cloud infrastructure repo.

These workflows have no GitHub Actions archives of Bazel, Gradle, or sccache
build outputs to remove. The Bazel remote profile already disables its redundant
disk action cache. Repository downloads and worker-local file caches remain
useful alongside the shared CAS.

The pinned C/C++ compiler wrapper normalizes its location to an execroot-relative
path when an OCI runtime invokes it by absolute path inside the working directory.
This keeps generated header dependency paths valid under Bazel's existing strict
checks. Tools outside that directory retain their absolute path; compiler versions,
header allowlists, and macOS SDK selection are unchanged.
